This is a tool used to check the binary classification performance data quality.
1. Given confusion matrix,  it can compute 13 (including 12 performance measurements: FPR, FNR, TNR, ER, recall, precision, accuracy, FMeasure, MCC, GMeasure, GMean, Balance).
2. Given 2 or 3 performance measurements and defect density of a dataset, re-compute confusion matrix.
3. Check whether there is any data quality problem in binary classification performance measurement.
